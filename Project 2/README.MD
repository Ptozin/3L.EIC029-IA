## Cancer Prediction

![Cancer Prediction](images/cancer.jpg)

The goal of this project is to predict whether a cancer biopsy is benign or malignant, based on the 30 attributes mentioned above. This is a binary classification problem, where the target variable is the diagnosis, which can be either benign or malignant.

The solution to this problem is a supervised learning model, which will be trained using the dataset mentioned above. The model will be trained using the training set, and then evaluated using the test set. The model will be evaluated using the accuracy metric, which is the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
